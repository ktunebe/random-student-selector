# random-student-selector

## Description

This is a project for UW bootcamp in which we needed a way to randomly select students during class and avoid repeating the same selection until everyone had been called on.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

On clicking the "Select Random Student" button, a function will run to select a student from the class list. It will then add a count to their called on total, which will prevent them from being called on again. Once every student has been called, the counts reset.
